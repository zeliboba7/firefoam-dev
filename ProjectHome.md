FireFOAM is a CFD code for modeling fire and suppression based on OpenFOAM (R) http://www.openfoam.org. OpenFOAM (R) is a general purpose open source CFD toolbox written in C++. It utilizes the finite volume method on arbitrarily unstructured meshes, and is highly scalable on massively parallel computers. For more information about OpenFOAM, please refer to http://www.opencfd.co.uk/openfoam/index.html#openfoam.

Current capabilities of FireFOAM include simulation of buoyancy-driven turbulent flows, non-premixed combustion, thermal radiation, solid fuel pyrolysis, Lagrangian droplet tracking, surface film flow, etc. Other sub-models for modeling fire growth and suppression are under development. For more information about FireFOAM and research related to fire modeling at FM Global, please see the Open CFD fire modeling website. (http://sites.google.com/site/firemodelingworkshop)
